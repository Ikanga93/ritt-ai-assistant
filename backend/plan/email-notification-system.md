# Email Notification System Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step plan for implementing email notifications in the Ritt Drive-Thru application, with a focus on payment link emails. The system will use SendGrid as the email service provider and integrate with the existing temporary order storage and payment link generation flow.

## Phase 1: Setup and Configuration

1. **Update Environment Configuration**
   - Add SendGrid API keys to `.env` file:
     ```
     SENDGRID_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
     SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=<verified_sender_email>
     SENDGRID_FROM_NAME=Ritt Drive-Thru
     ```
   - Ensure these variables are documented in `.env.example`

2. **Install Required Dependencies**
   - Add SendGrid SDK: `npm install @sendgrid/mail`
   - Add templating engine: `npm install handlebars`
   - Add retry mechanism: `npm install async-retry`

3. **Create Email Service Structure**
   - Create `src/services/emailService.ts` for core email functionality
   - Create `src/services/orderEmailService.ts` for order-specific email logic
   - Create `src/templates/emails/` directory for email templates

## Phase 2: Email Template Development

1. **Create Base HTML Template**
   - Develop responsive HTML base template with header, footer, and content area
   - Include Ritt Drive-Thru branding and styling
   - Ensure mobile compatibility

2. **Create Order-Specific Templates**
   - Order confirmation template with payment link button
   - Order receipt template (for after payment)
   - Payment reminder template (for pending payments)
   - Order status update template

3. **Implement Template Variables**
   - Customer information: name, email
   - Order details: ID, items, quantities, prices
   - Payment information: total, tax, processing fees
   - Payment link with expiration time
   - Restaurant information

## Phase 3: Email Service Implementation

1. **Core Email Service**
   - Initialize SendGrid with API key
   - Create email sending function with retry logic
   - Implement template rendering with variable substitution
   - Add logging for all email operations

2. **Order Email Service**
   - Create function to send payment link emails
   - Implement order confirmation email logic
   - Add payment reminder functionality
   - Create receipt generation for completed orders

3. **Email Tracking and Status**
   - Store email delivery status in order metadata
   - Implement webhook endpoint for SendGrid delivery events
   - Create retry mechanism for failed deliveries
   - Add email delivery reporting

## Phase 4: Integration with Order Flow

1. **Update Order Payment Link Service**
   - Modify `generateOrderPaymentLink` to trigger email notification
   - Add email status to order metadata
   - Implement email sending after payment link generation

2. **Add Email Triggers**
   - Send email notification when payment link is generated
   - Send receipt email when payment is completed
   - Send reminder emails for pending payments
   - Add email notifications for order status changes

3. **Create Email Testing Scripts**
   - Develop test script for email template rendering
   - Create test for email sending functionality
   - Implement end-to-end test for order flow with emails

## Phase 5: Admin Features and Monitoring

1. **Email Status Dashboard**
   - Add email delivery status to admin interface
   - Create manual email resend functionality
   - Implement email open/click tracking

2. **Email Analytics**
   - Track email delivery rates
   - Monitor email open and click rates
   - Analyze payment conversion from emails

3. **Monitoring and Alerts**
   - Set up alerts for email delivery failures
   - Create monitoring for email queue health
   - Implement reporting for email-related metrics

## Implementation Timeline

- **Week 1**: Setup, configuration, and base email service
- **Week 2**: Template development and order email service
- **Week 3**: Integration with order flow and testing
- **Week 4**: Admin features, monitoring, and optimization

## Best Practices to Follow

1. **Email Deliverability**
   - Use verified sender domains
   - Implement SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records
   - Follow CAN-SPAM compliance guidelines
   - Include unsubscribe links in all emails

2. **Performance**
   - Use asynchronous email sending to avoid blocking
   - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Queue emails for high-volume periods
   - Pre-compile templates for better performance

3. **Security**
   - Never expose API keys in client-side code
   - Validate all email addresses before sending
   - Sanitize all user inputs used in emails
   - Use HTTPS links in all emails

4. **Testing**
   - Test emails on multiple devices and clients
   - Use SendGrid's test mode for development
   - Implement automated tests for email flows
   - Regularly audit email deliverability

## Technical Implementation Details

### Email Service Interface
```typescript
interface EmailOptions {
  to: string;
  subject: string;
  templateName: string;
  templateData: Record<string, any>;
  attachments?: Array<{
    content: string;
    filename: string;
    type: string;
    disposition: string;
  }>;
}

interface EmailResult {
  success: boolean;
  messageId?: string;
  error?: Error;
  timestamp: number;
}
```

### Email Status Tracking
```typescript
type EmailStatus = 'queued' | 'sent' | 'delivered' | 'opened' | 'clicked' | 'bounced' | 'failed';

interface EmailTrackingInfo {
  messageId: string;
  status: EmailStatus;
  sentAt: number;
  deliveredAt?: number;
  openedAt?: number;
  clickedAt?: number;
  failedAt?: number;
  failureReason?: string;
  retryCount: number;
}
```

### Order Metadata Extension
```typescript
interface OrderEmailMetadata {
  paymentLinkEmailSent: boolean;
  paymentLinkEmailSentAt?: number;
  paymentLinkEmailStatus?: EmailStatus;
  paymentLinkEmailMessageId?: string;
  receiptEmailSent?: boolean;
  receiptEmailSentAt?: number;
  reminderEmailsSent?: number;
  lastReminderSentAt?: number;
}
```

## Next Steps
1. Update environment configuration files
2. Install required dependencies
3. Create basic email service structure
4. Develop HTML email templates
5. Implement core email sending functionality
6. Integrate with order payment link generation
7. Test email delivery and tracking
8. Add admin features and monitoring
