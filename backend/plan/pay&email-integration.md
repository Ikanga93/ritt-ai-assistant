# Payment Link Generation & Email Integration Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the steps to implement a streamlined order processing flow where:
1. Customer submits an order
2. Payment link is created immediately
3. Order confirmation with payment link is sent to customer via email
4. Upon payment confirmation, order is sent to restaurant dashboard
5. Order is stored in the database after completion

This approach prioritizes customer experience and restaurant efficiency by ensuring only paid orders reach the restaurant dashboard.

## Goals

1. Provide immediate order confirmation and payment options to customers
2. Ensure restaurants only receive paid orders
3. Optimize database usage by storing only completed orders
4. Create a reliable system for tracking payment status
5. Implement robust email communication for order status updates

## Implementation Plan

   - Implement email sending service with error handling and retries

### Phase 2: Order Submission & Email Notification

1. **Update Order Submission Endpoint**
   - Modify API to accept and validate order submissions
   - Generate temporary order IDs with appropriate prefixes
   - Implement comprehensive error handling

2. **Implement Payment Link Generation**
   - Create service to generate Stripe payment links for temporary orders
   - Include order details and expiration in payment link metadata
   - Add logging for payment link creation events

3. **Develop Email Notification System**
   - Create service to send order confirmation emails
   - Include payment link, order summary, and estimated preparation time
   - Implement tracking for email delivery status

### Phase 3: Payment Processing & Restaurant Notification

1. **Enhance Stripe Webhook Handling**
   - Update webhook endpoint to process payment confirmations
   - Implement validation for payment events
   - Add comprehensive logging for payment status changes

2. **Create Restaurant Dashboard Integration**
   - Develop service to push paid orders to restaurant dashboard
   - Implement real-time updates using WebSockets
   - Add prioritization based on order type and time

3. **Implement Order Storage Logic**
   - Create service to store completed orders in the database
   - Add transaction support for data consistency
   - Implement archiving strategy for historical orders

### Phase 4: Error Handling & Recovery Mechanisms

1. **Implement Comprehensive Error Handling**
   - Create recovery mechanisms for payment processing failures
   - Develop retry logic for email delivery failures
   - Implement monitoring for system component health

2. **Develop Order Reconciliation System**
   - Create service to match paid orders with temporary records
   - Implement cleanup for abandoned/expired orders
   - Add administrative tools for manual reconciliation

3. **Enhance Logging & Monitoring**
   - Set up centralized logging for the entire order flow
   - Implement alerts for critical failures
   - Create dashboards for system performance monitoring

### Phase 5: Testing & Deployment

1. **Develop Comprehensive Test Suite**
   - Create unit tests for individual components
   - Implement integration tests for the complete flow
   - Develop stress tests for high-volume scenarios

2. **Set Up Analytics & Reporting**
   - Track key metrics like payment conversion rate
   - Monitor time from order submission to restaurant notification
   - Analyze customer behavior patterns

3. **Plan Phased Deployment**
   - Deploy to development environment for initial testing
   - Roll out to a subset of restaurants for validation
   - Implement full production deployment with monitoring

## Detailed Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Set Up Temporary Order Storage
1. Create a lightweight data structure for temporary orders
2. Implement unique ID generation with "TEMP-" prefix
3. Add timestamp and expiration logic
4. Create cleanup job for expired temporary orders

### Step 2: Enhance Payment Link Generation
1. Modify Stripe integration to work with temporary orders
2. Add order details as metadata in payment links
3. Set appropriate expiration times (24-48 hours)
4. Implement logging for payment link creation

### Step 3: Develop Email Notification System
1. Set up email service provider integration
2. Create HTML templates for order confirmation emails
3. Implement email sending service with retry logic
4. Add tracking for email delivery status

### Step 4: Update Order Submission API
1. Modify API to create temporary orders
2. Generate payment links immediately after order validation
3. Send confirmation emails with payment links
4. Return appropriate response to customer

### Step 5: Enhance Webhook Handling
1. Update Stripe webhook endpoint for payment confirmations
2. Implement validation for payment events
3. Add logic to match payments with temporary orders
4. Create service to notify restaurant dashboard

### Step 6: Implement Restaurant Dashboard Integration
1. Create service to push paid orders to dashboard
2. Implement WebSocket for real-time updates
3. Add order prioritization logic
4. Develop status tracking for restaurant order acceptance

### Step 7: Create Database Storage Logic
1. Develop service to store completed orders
2. Implement transaction handling for data consistency
3. Create archiving strategy for historical orders
4. Add reporting capabilities for business analytics

## Considerations & Potential Issues

1. **Payment Timing**
   - Set appropriate expiration times for payment links
   - Implement clear communication about payment deadlines
   - Create recovery process for expired payment links

2. **System Resilience**
   - Ensure webhook handling is robust with retry mechanisms
   - Implement fallbacks for email delivery failures
   - Create monitoring for all critical system components

3. **Data Consistency**
   - Maintain reliable connections between temporary and final orders
   - Implement proper transaction handling for database operations
   - Create reconciliation processes for edge cases

4. **User Experience**
   - Ensure email templates are clear and mobile-friendly
   - Make payment process as frictionless as possible
   - Provide clear status updates throughout the order lifecycle

## Success Metrics
