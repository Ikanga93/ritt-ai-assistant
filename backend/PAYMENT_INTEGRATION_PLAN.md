# Payment Link Integration Plan for Ritt Drive-Thru

## Phase 1: Setup and Configuration

1. **Install Stripe SDK**
   - Use pnpm to install the Stripe package
   - Add types for TypeScript support

2. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Add Stripe API keys to .env.local file
   - Set up webhook secret for secure callbacks
   - Configure payment link expiration settings

3. **Create Payment Service Module**
   - Create a new file for payment service functionality
   - Set up Stripe client initialization
   - Add logging for payment operations

## Phase 2: Payment Link Generation

4. **Define Payment Link Data Structure**
   - Create interfaces for payment link request/response
   - Define payment statuses (pending, paid, failed, expired)
   - Add payment link metadata structure

5. **Implement Payment Link Generation Function**
   - Create function to generate Stripe payment links
   - Include order details in payment metadata
   - Set appropriate expiration time
   - Add success/failure handling

6. **Add Payment Link Storage**
   - Extend order storage to include payment information
   - Store payment link ID, URL, and status
   - Add timestamps for payment-related events

## Phase 3: Order Flow Integration

7. **Modify Order Processing Flow**
   - Update order creation to include payment status
   - Add payment link generation step after order creation
   - Ensure correlation IDs track through payment process

8. **Implement Payment Status Updates**
   - Create functions to update order payment status
   - Add payment verification checks
   - Implement payment expiration handling

9. **Add Payment Link Regeneration**
   - Create function to regenerate expired payment links
   - Add admin capability to manually trigger regeneration
   - Implement payment link versioning

## Phase 4: Webhook and Notifications

10. **Create Stripe Webhook Handler**
    - Add endpoint to receive Stripe events
    - Implement signature verification for security
    - Handle payment success, failure, and dispute events

11. **Update Order Status Based on Webhooks**
    - Process payment confirmation events
    - Update order status when payment succeeds
    - Handle payment failure scenarios

12. **Implement Payment Notifications**
    - Send confirmation when payment is received
    - Notify restaurant of paid orders
    - Alert on payment failures or disputes

## Phase 5: Email Integration

13. **Set Up Email Service**
    - Install and configure email sending library
    - Create email templates for payment links
    - Set up email queue for reliable delivery

14. **Implement Order Confirmation Emails**
    - Create function to send order confirmation
    - Include payment link in email
    - Add order details and restaurant information

15. **Add Payment Success Emails**
    - Send receipt email after successful payment
    - Include order details and payment information
    - Add estimated preparation/delivery time

## Phase 6: Testing and Deployment

16. **Test Payment Flow in Development**
    - Use Stripe test mode for payment testing
    - Verify webhook handling with test events
    - Test email delivery with test accounts

17. **Implement Error Handling and Monitoring**
    - Add comprehensive error handling
    - Set up monitoring for payment processes
    - Create alerts for payment failures

18. **Deploy to Production**
    - Deploy changes using existing workflow
    - Switch to production Stripe keys
    - Monitor initial payment processing

## Phase 7: Admin Features

19. **Add Payment Management Features**
    - Create endpoints to view payment statuses
    - Add ability to manually trigger payment emails
    - Implement payment reporting features

20. **Create Payment Analytics**
    - Track payment conversion rates
    - Monitor time-to-payment metrics
    - Analyze payment failure reasons

## Implementation Notes

- All package installations should be done using pnpm as per project standards
- Maintain compatibility with existing file-based storage system during development
- Ensure proper error handling and logging throughout the payment process
- Use correlation IDs to track orders across the entire system
- Consider fixing database constraint issues before final deployment
